# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the quality of red wine using machine learning. It applies data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model training on the **Wine Quality Dataset** to estimate wine quality scores based on physicochemical properties such as acidity, sugar, alcohol, and pH.

A practical use case: a winery can use this model to quickly estimate whether a batch of wine is likely to score high or low, helping guide production decisions.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer  
- pip (or conda)  
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab  

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prossy20/mlprojectwinequalityprediction.git
   cd mlprojectwinequalityprediction
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
   ```

   Or with conda:

   ```bash
   conda create -n wineqa python=3.9
   conda activate wineqa
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > If `requirements.txt` is missing, install common packages manually:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

4. **Run the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook wine-quality-prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Inside the notebook you can:

1. **Explore the dataset** – visualize distributions, correlations, and trends.
2. **Preprocess the data** – handle missing values, scale features, and split into train/test sets.
3. **Train models** – compare algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
4. **Evaluate performance** – using metrics like RMSE or classification accuracy.
5. **Predict new samples** – provide wine measurements and let the model predict a quality score.

## 🧪 Example Prediction

Given the following measurements:

* Fixed Acidity: 7.4
* Volatile Acidity: 0.70
* Citric Acid: 0.00
* Residual Sugar: 1.9
* Chlorides: 0.076
* Free Sulfur Dioxide: 11.0
* Total Sulfur Dioxide: 34.0
* Density: 0.9978
* pH: 3.51
* Sulphates: 0.56
* Alcohol: 9.4

➡️ The model outputs a predicted wine quality score of **5.1**.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add a saved trained model (`.pkl`/`.joblib`) for direct predictions without retraining.
* Implement hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).
* Extend to **white wine dataset** for broader coverage.
* Build a simple **CLI** or **web app** for non-technical users.
